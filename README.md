# LearningWithQiskit
A demonstration of what I've tried so far in quantum computing, using the Qiskit library for python 3.
The output file shows what a typical run looks like, around 50% of the bits go to 11, the others go to 00. It is different every time, but stays within a range of ~50.
This is a simulated experiment that did not run on an actual quantum computer.
